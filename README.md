# Women in Tech Demo Day Hackathon

## The Challenge
Help inspire more girls to learn coding by creating a solution that enables girls to imagine themselves as computer scientists.

## Our Solution
GURL is a customizable, imaginative resource portal for girls to learn about female role models in Tech and start their own coding adventures. Inspired by popular Buzzfeed quizzes, we aim to inspire girls through a "Find Out Your Female Tech Superstar" quiz and provide them with customized learning materials suited to their age, interests and learning style.
